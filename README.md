# Bio-Sequence Search using the Burrows-Wheeler Transform

## Current Version:
 - Index and search protein or nucleotide sequences
 - Index a single or multi-fasta file, or a string input
 - Search index for input sequences, using string, single or multi-fasta

## Additions To Come:
 - Memory Clearage
 - BaseMap() using binary
 - Substitution matrix input
 - E-values of alignments

### To Compile:
 1. Clone this repository to your local machine
 2. Run "make" in the protein or nucl directories, depending on what sequence files you plan to use
 3. Excutables will now available in the directory that "make was run in
    - Use "-h" during execution for additional help
